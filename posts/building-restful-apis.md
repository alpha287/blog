# Building RESTful APIs with Express: Best Practices and Patterns

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing web services. When building APIs with Express.js, following RESTful principles ensures your API is intuitive, scalable, and maintainable.

## Understanding REST Principles

REST is based on several key principles:

1. **Stateless**: Each request should contain all the information needed to process it
2. **Client-Server**: Clear separation between client and server responsibilities
3. **Cacheable**: Responses should be cacheable when appropriate
4. **Uniform Interface**: Consistent way to interact with resources
5. **Layered System**: Architecture can be composed of multiple layers

## Setting Up Your Express API

Let's start with a basic Express setup for our API:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// CORS middleware (if needed)
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');
  next();
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`API server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
