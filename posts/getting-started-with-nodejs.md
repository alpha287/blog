# Getting Started with Node.js and Express: A Complete Guide

Node.js has revolutionized web development by allowing developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to build scalable web applications using Node.js and the Express framework.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server, making it possible to build entire web applications using a single programming language.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before we dive into Express, let's set up our development environment. You'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine.

```bash
# Check if Node.js is installed
node --version

# Initialize a new project
npm init -y

# Install Express
npm install express
